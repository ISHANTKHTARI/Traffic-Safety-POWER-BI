# Traffic-Safety-POWER-BI

In this Activity, you have been commissioned by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to create a dashboard.
It needs to show the improving road safety over the time period 2007-2018 by state. The target the NHTSA has is 1.02 fatalities per 100,000,000 miles driven.
To assist you, please use the spreadsheet "Driving Safety"
The spreadsheet has:
•	The state, year, miles traveled and actual fatalities,
•	The actual fatalities per 100,000,000 miles.
•	The target level of fatalities, and
•	The actual fatalities per 100,000,000 miles in the last year of the data, 2018.
